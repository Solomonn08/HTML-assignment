I used this prompt “create an HTML for a guide to play tennis, you must include at least 3 different heading levels, multiple paragraphs consist of at least 4, an unordered list (ul with li items), an ordered list (ol with li items), at least 2 external links and 2 images, a table with at least 3 rows and 2 columns, and keep in mind, do not be limited with " at least", add your own ideas. Additionally, add CSS file by adding colors, using at least 10 different CSS properties across the pages, typography, spacing, layouts and borders with effects. use at least 3 class selectors, 1 D selector and 2 element selectors. Include coherent color scheme not a random colors and add hover effect to at least one element. Make it run on Python3” which is a bit long and seemingly copied from your list. 
The code at first worked well, except it gave errors implementing images due to lack of details. So I downloaded the images on google as “jpg” and send it to gemini to put them into the code, and ultimately It did.  
In the process of creating an HTML, AI basically explained the code, what each character was for and etc…
